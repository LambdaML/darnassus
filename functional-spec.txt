The job Coordinator should:
* Accept, validate and submit new jobs
* Track jobs which it has submitted (becomes the coordinator)
* Submit for a job to be stopped
* Submit for a job to be deleted
* Keep track of liveness for jobs it coordinates
* Publish its internal state so that other coordinators in the cluster are aware
* Persist it's jobs so that they can be restarted on redeploy
* Keep track of liveness of other coordinators
* Rebalance jobs from a downed coordinator
